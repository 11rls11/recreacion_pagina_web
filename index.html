        <h3>Who is kollektiv orangotango?</h3>
        <p>
            kollektiv orangotango was founded in 2008.
            Since then it has been constantly developing
            through a network of critical geographers,
            friends and activists who deal with questions
            regarding space, power and resistance.
            With our geographical activism, we seek to
            support processes and oppositional actors
            who instigate social change by prefiguring
            social alternatives.

            We conduct emancipatory educational work as
            well as concrete political and artistic interventions.
            These are supposed to enforce reflections on and changes
            of social conditions. Through workshops, publications,
            mappings, excursions, and creative interventions within
            public space, we collectively learn how to read space
            and how to initiate emancipatory processes from below.
            By sticking to the traditions of activist research,
            we connect theoretical reflections and concrete actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far we have engaged in the fields of right to the city,
            (urban) agriculture, critical pedagogy, alternative housing
            and solidarity economy, mostly in Europe and also in Latin
            America. But kollektiv orangotango also functions as a
            platform for different actions. In the case of Not-an-Atlas,
            its publication was realized by kollektiv orangotango
            in cooperation with other activists and academics.
            That is the reason why it was named kollektiv orangotango.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this is happening through collective and self-organized
            practice. In other words: “We’re going slow, because we’re going far”!

        <h3>
            How to Edit and Reflect Counter-Cartographies Collectively as
            Activists and Academics?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Both our activist experiences with collective and critical mapping
            workshops as kollektiv orangotango as well as our individual and
            academic engagements with maps served as starting points for
            Not-an-Atlas. In the spring of 2015 we released a
            <a href="http://kritische-karten.net/index.php/call-for-papers/">
                Call for Maps in English, German and Spanish
            </a>, inviting everyone engaged with
            practices of critical mapping to send us ideas, texts, photos and,
            of course, maps. We were overwhelmed by the resonance!
            Nearly 150 submissions found their way to us.
            Some of them came from places, struggles and activists we had not
            heard of before; others came from long-time companions and friends.
            Among them were contributions from well-known critical cartographers,
            activists, and social movements who have been working with maps for
            many years; but even more emerging mapmakers sent us their proposals.
            What followed were exciting three years of discussing, selecting
            and editing the various maps and projects. Again and again we had
            to ask ourselves: What actually makes a map (not) critical?
            And what do we (not) have in mind when working on a counter-atlas?
            We also had to continually negotiate between more activist and more
            academic modes of knowledge production – be it in regards to the
            content of the maps or in regards to our own mode of working and living.
            With the large number of submissions, Not-an-Atlas quickly outgrew its
            initial frame in terms of involved languages, time and resources.
            The resulting process of collective learning therefore included
            various challenges, personal fluctuations and surprises.
            There we started to think about an online version of Not-an-Atlas.
            So we understand <a href="http://notanatlas.org/">notanatlas.org</a>
            as a continuation of the Not-an-Atlas book. Because we want to continue
            to share maps, struggles, projects, texts and inspirations online.
